# SQL Injection Exploit on PHP Login Page

 üî∞ For SQl Injection Use this=> ' or 1=1 -- -
 üî∞ For Faculty login Use this=> username: User / Password: 1234

This repository demonstrates a SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability on a PHP-based login page. SQL Injection is a common attack method used to exploit web applications by manipulating SQL queries through user inputs, allowing unauthorized access to the system. In this project, I've highlighted how attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive information by injecting malicious SQL code into the login form.

# Features:
Demonstration of SQL Injection vulnerability on a PHP login form.
Example of a vulnerable SQL query with user input directly inserted without validation.
Steps to exploit the vulnerability using standard SQL injection techniques (e.g., ' OR '1'='1).
Recommendations for securing the login page against SQL Injection, including prepared statements and parameterized queries.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This repository is for educational purposes only. It shows how improper handling of SQL queries can lead to vulnerabilities. Do not use this technique on live systems or without permission.
